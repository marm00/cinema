# This is the default configuration file for Cinema.
# Here is a brief tutorial using comments (lines starting with #).
# You can skip directly to the bottom for real settings.

# A [media] table is used to add media (files, urls) to the default
# playlist, with optional tags to limit the media to this group.
# Anything you put below a [table] is bound to it.
#
# Example: [media]

# The directories key is used to collect all files inside of a
# directory recursively. For example, adding C: would include
# all files in all directories on the C drive.
#
# Example: directories = C:\foo

# You can separate directories and most other keys with commas 
# or repeating the keys on a new line, like:
#
# Example: directories = C:\foo, C:\bar
# Example: directories = C:\baz

# The patterns key is used to target individual or multiple files
# matching a specific pattern. You can for instance use wildcard characters 
# like C:\*.png to target all files with the .png extension. Check out
# https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/examples-of-wildcard-characters-939e153f-bd30-47e4-a763-61897c87b3f4
# for more information. Note that this does not work recursively.
#
# Example: patterns = C:\foo\*.png

# The urls key is used to collect urls such as twitch channels or
# youtube videos. These are case-sensitive (but searching is not).
#
# Example: urls = https://twitch.tv/caedrel

# The tags key allows you to group all of the collected media in 
# this [media] table under one or more names. For example, setting
# tags = test and executing the command tag test in Cinema will
# limit the current playlist to only this media.
#
# Example: tags = test

# A [layout] table allows you to specify the number of screens
# (windows displaying media using mpv), their position and size,
# the position and size of chat, and activate it by name.
#
# Example: [layout]

# Setting the name will enable you to execute the layout command
# in Cinema to display the correct screens and chat, such as
# name = foo and executing layout foo.
#
# Example: name = foo

# The screen keys are directly forward as the --geometry argument to
# mpv. See: https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#options-geometry for more
# information. This allows you to specify a monitor and very specific
# positioning and size values; look at the examples shown in the link.
# You can avoid setting the screens here manually by using the store
# command in Cinema after adjusting the screens to your liking.
#
# Example: screen = 10%x10%+0+0

# The chat key will make the layout display a chat (chatterino), with
# the following format: [width]x[height]±[x]±[y]. Note that this format
# is different from mpv --geometry, and can also be saved automatically
# using the store command in Cinema.
#
# Example: chat = 640x947+50+49

# A [macro] table allows you to execute multiple commands with just one
# command. This works identically to typing out multiple commands in a 
# row. You can use startup = yes to execute the macro as Cinema launches.
# You can execute a macro by using the macro command in Cinema and typing
# the name of the macro defined under this table.
#
# Example: [macro]

# The name of a macro is used by the macro command in Cinema.
#
# Example: name = foo

# The command key defines what commands will be executed, sequentially,
# and what arguments are provided. To see what is possible, look at the
# list of commands.
#
# Example: command = layout foo

# When startup = yes, this macro will run when you launch Cinema.
#
# Example: startup = yes

# This is the end of the tutorial. Below are default Cinema settings.
# You can change everything and add anything.
